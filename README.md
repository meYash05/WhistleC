# 🎯 WhistleC – Cooker Whistle Detection (Java FFT + Python ML)

This project detects pressure cooker whistles using two approaches:
- 🔧 Java-based signal processing (FFT)
- 🤖 Python-based machine learning

---

## 📁 Structure

### 🔧 Java FFT Version
- Folder: `java_fft_version/`
- Uses FFT to detect whistle frequencies
- No ML involved

### 🤖 ML Python Version
- Folder: `ml_python_version/`
- Extracts MFCC/ZCR features from audio
- Trains MLP classifier for real-time whistle detection

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Choose version:
   - Java: Open in IntelliJ or Eclipse and run `WhistleC.java`
   - Python: Use scripts to train model and run real-time detection
2. Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
3. Model is saved in `models/` folder for reuse
